## $YOGI Distribution Proportional to Liquidity Contribution

To make the token distribution as fair as possible, we distribute $YOGI tokens proportional to the amount of liquidity each address contributed, relative to the total liquidity on Yogi. Since there is liquidity in several different tokens, we use the USD value as the common measure.
