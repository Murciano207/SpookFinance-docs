# YOGI Governance Token

Since inception, our goal at Yogi Studio has been to decentralize and diversify governance of the [Yogi Protocol](https://yogi.fi/). We have looked into several approaches and designs, and have landed on an approach we are proud to share: the Yogi Protocol Governance Token \(YOGI\).

We believe alignment between token holders and protocol stakeholders is crucial for successful decentralized governance. More explicitly, we believe YOGI tokens are the vehicle to drive alignment and participation in the protocol. YOGI tokens are not an investment; YOGI token holders should be people who interact with the protocol in some way, are committed to its future development, and want a seat at the governance table.

## Yogiâ€™s Most Important Stakeholders: Liquidity Providers

The Yogi Protocol allows any BSC account to add liquidity in the form of tokens to existing Yogi pools, or even create their own pools.

Liquidity attracts traders, trading generates fees, and ultimately pool profitability attracts more liquidity. This is a flywheel effect that we are beginning to see happen within the Yogi Protocol.

Regardless of the venue, early liquidity providers take on more risk and opportunity cost: including contract risk, low initial pool profitability, etc. We believe that these protocol users should get to participate early on in deciding how the protocol evolves. Toward this end, Yogi Studio proposed and implemented the concept of liquidity mining, where Yogi governance tokens \(YOGIs\) are distributed to liquidity providers. See below for further details.

## Future Yogi Versions and the Governance Token

YOGIs are a key way of decentralizing the governance of the protocol such that it remains resilient over time, and protected from the failure of any single stakeholder. Our governance needs to be as resilient as our technology infrastructure.

We expect token holders to help guide the protocol to its fullest potential through experimentation and active participation. For example, implementing new functionality, deploying the protocol on additional smart contract blockchains beyond BSC, using layer 2 solutions for scaling, introducing a protocol level fee, etc. Anything contentious will certainly go to the YOGI token holders for review.

## Token Supply and Distribution

The total supply of YOGI tokens will be capped at 100M. 50M on BSC, 50M on Polygon.

**20M** YOGI tokens were initially allocated to founders and team members, all subject to vesting periods.

**10M** were allocated for the *Yogi IDO*. It will take place shortly after Yogi is live. Unsold tokens will be returned to the timelock and the community will decide how to allocate them.

**10M** were allocated for the *Yogi Ecosystem Fund*. This fund will be deployed to attract and incentivize strategic partners who will help the Yogi ecosystem grow and thrive. YOGI holders will ultimately decide how this fund is used over the coming years.

**10M** were allocated to incentivize future contributors and developers that will help shape the future of Yogi.

The remaining 50M tokens are intended to be mostly distributed to liquidity providers in the coming years.

Every week 384,000 YOGIs, or approximately 20M per year, are distributed to liquidity providers.

This high rate of supply inflation is meant to kickstart the distribution of governance rights of the protocol to those who earn it.

The schedule of YOGI distribution over the next few years will be extensively discussed within the Yogi community, and will ultimately be decided by YOGI holders.
