# YOGI Liquidity Mining

## YOGI Distribution Proportional to total Liquidity in the platform

To make the token distribution as fair as possible, we distribute YOGI tokens proportional to the amount of liquidity each address contributed, relative to the total liquidity in the platform. Since there is liquidity in several different tokens, we use the USD value as the common measure.

$YOGI tokens will be directly distributed to Liquidity providers on a weekly basis. If you are providing liquidity to a pool with at least 2 whitelisted assets, you will receive $YOGI tokens periodically without any other interaction required.
